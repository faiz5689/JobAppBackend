# Job Application Microservices Platform

A modern, scalable job application platform built with Spring Boot microservices architecture. This project demonstrates the implementation of a distributed system using contemporary cloud-native technologies and best practices.

## üåü Features

- Microservices-based architecture
- Job posting and application management
- Company profiles and management
- Review system for companies
- Service discovery with Eureka
- API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway
- Distributed tracing with Zipkin
- Message queuing with RabbitMQ
- Centralized configuration with Spring Cloud Config
- Circuit breaking and fault tolerance with Resilience4J
- Containerization with Docker
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- PostgreSQL database integration

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application is divided into the following microservices:

- **Job Service**: Manages job postings and applications
- **Company Service**: Handles company profiles and information
- **Review Service**: Manages company reviews and ratings
- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management
- **Service Registry**: Service discovery using Eureka
- **API Gateway**: Request routing and load balancing
- **Authentication Service**: User authentication and authorization

## üöÄ Technologies

- **Spring Boot**: Core framework for building microservices
- **Spring Cloud**: For cloud-native patterns implementation
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database
- **RabbitMQ**: Message queue
- **Zipkin**: Distributed tracing
- **Resilience4J**: Circuit breaking and fault tolerance
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build tool

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or later
- Maven 3.6+
- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube for local development)
- PostgreSQL
- RabbitMQ

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd job-application-platform
```

2. Start the required services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Start the microservices in order:
```bash
# Start Config Server first
cd configserver
mvn spring-boot:run

# Start Service Registry
cd ../service-registry
mvn spring-boot:run

# Start other services
cd ../jobms
mvn spring-boot:run

cd ../companyms
mvn spring-boot:run

cd ../reviewms
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Docker Deployment

Build and run all services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

1. Build Docker images for all services
2. Apply Kubernetes configurations:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```
